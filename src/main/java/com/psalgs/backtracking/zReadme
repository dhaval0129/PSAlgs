Backtracking Algorithm Problems

Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) 
solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems, 
that incrementally builds candidates to the solutions, and abandons 
each partial candidate ("backtracks") as soon as it determines that the 
candidate cannot possibly be completed to a valid solution.

1] Backtracking problems can be solved using combination of loop on top and recursion inside
2] General approach for backtracking is recursion inside for loop
