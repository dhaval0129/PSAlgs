Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem 
by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid 
computing the same results again

Here is link which explains how Dynamic programming problems can be solved

3] If we decide use bottom up approach for dynamic programming then array size will be (n+1)
